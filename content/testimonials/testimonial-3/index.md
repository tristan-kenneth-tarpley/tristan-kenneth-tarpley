Market(r) has been a standout member of WeWork Labs.  I recommend them for these reasons:  1) Team – the Market(r) founders are incredibly scrappy and resourceful in building technology that benefits users.  They have managed to do what few other founders could— they built a B2B SaaS app 100% bootstrapped and have attracted paying clients.  2) Problem-focused – they are solving the biggest problem in marketing ecosystem, the last frontier-- that existing marketing tech solutions are built for the doers, not for the decision-makers. For decision-makers, the job is still very much more art than science.   3) Customer-centric – they first created an agency that solved real customer’s problems, then built a platform that gives their customers superpowers.  They roll out a new feature, then see how their customers use the tools, and iterate.  Great examples of LEAN product principles driving toward product-market-fit.
