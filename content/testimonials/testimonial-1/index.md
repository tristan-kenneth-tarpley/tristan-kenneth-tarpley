"I have the incredible pleasure of working with Tristan for the last few years. He is one of a very rare breed. One of the few people who possesses the commitment, talents, and dedication to have a vision of an incredibly complex tech product to solve the biggest problem in marketing, and then be able to translate high-level user stories into functional end-to-end code that look beautiful in-app without the luxury of pixel-perfect designs or books worth of business requirements. His mind is a spongy steel trap that eagerly absorbs and actually retains developer (and business and marketing) knowledge at a rate and quality I've not seen before. Anyone is lucky to snatch him up for their team. He will be a tremendous asset, and make an excellent leader when the opportunity arises. "
